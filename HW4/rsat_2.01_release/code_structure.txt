======================
Code structure of RSat
======================

This file contains brief information about the structure of
the source code of RSat. Function summary is also provided in
the header of every file.

We structure the code such that high-level and low-level 
functions are in different files. The hope is that if you are 
not planning on optimizing any low-level details, you should not 
need to touch those low-level files.

For example, all the core solving functions are in solver.cpp.
By looking at this relatively short file, you can already see
the whole structure of the solver.

Note that we have also privided a relatively extensive amount of 
comments for all files.
